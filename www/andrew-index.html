<h1><u>Homepage of the DASM Assembler</u></h1>
<h2>DASM</h2>

<p>This is the official home of DASM, an assembler written in 1997-1988 by Matthew Dillon, updated in 1995 by Olaf 'Rhialto' Seibert, and now (2003...) maintained by Andrew Davie.  DASM is a versatile macro assembler, written in C, with support for target microprocessors including 6502, 68HC11, 68705, 6803, HD6303, F8 and 6507.  Full source-code and selected target-machine runtimes are included in the distribution package.  

<h3>DASM Assembler Download</h3>
<p>The download package includes source code and executables for various platforms.  The most recent version is at the top of the following list.

<ul>
<li>'I built Linux and BeOS DASM binaries - feel free to include them in your 
distribution.  Included are the binaries, update readme files, and an update 
Makefile to pull in the F8 stuff and redefine stricmp for the unix-ish 
platforms.  It might be more conventional to do the redef in a source file, 
but I was already in the makefile... :)' -- James (slor@comcast.net)</li>
<li>'Attached is the Dasm 2.20.10 archive with a build for AmigaOS4. As with the
Mac, I've split the Amiga directory into "Classic" and "OS4", since the OS4
version only works on PowerPC based Amigas with version 4 of the operating
system. The Classic directory contains only a build of 2.20.07 still, since
I had some trouble getting 2.20.10 to build on my A4000.'  -- Peter Gordon</li>

<ul>
<li>Significant reformatting of code, prelude to full documentation. Code now in transient state between old and new formatting.  More modular, but still all over the place as far as consistency.  It'll improve as we go along.
<li>Internal error numbers now equated (more maintanable code).
<li>Command-line switches now allow / as prefix (and -).
<li>Divide by 0 (generated equates, etc.) now treated as an unrecoverable error.
<li>Error messages now contain more information about the error, including the source-code where possible.  Message templates allow inclusion of select data on error output.
<li>reworking of the output data.  Typically, the -v switch is now un-necessary as the appropriate messages to allow you to find errors will be output. Back compatibility with the -v options has been maintained, though there may be a few minor changes.
<li>Branch out of range errors now list the 'distance' to the branch.
<li>Undefined symbols are now *always* listed in a separate table.  If an unresolved symbol causes an error, then the table will be automatically displayed at the end of assembly.  Note: it is sometimes OK to have a referenced, but undefined symbol (eg: when IFNCONST is used, then the symbol becomes referenced, but being undefined is OK.  In this case, the undefined symbol table will only be output if there is another undefined label, but it will include ALL unresolved symbols).
<li>new command-line switch -T# where # is 0 or 1
<ul><li>0 = Sort symbol table alphabetically (default)
<li>1 = Sort symbol table by address
</ul>
If available memory precludes a sort, then the table will be output in a non-sorted order.

<p>You may redistribute the source code and binaries, provided that no modifications are made to either.  If you wish to have your code updates included in the official DASM release, please email the commented code changes to Andrew Davie (atari2600@taswegian.com).  If you'd like to request a feature, please do so.  If it's useful to enough people, I will try to add it.

<h1>Platform-Specific Support</h1>

<h2>Atari 2600</h2>

<p>The following ZIP file contains standardised files related to using DASM for developing for the Atari 2600.  It contains a standard list of names and equates for the hardware, registers, and memory mapping of the Atari 2600.  Also included (eventually!), standardised macros.  The idea is that you always grab the latest version from here - it will be backward-compatible with prior versions.  Please do not modify or redistribute these files.

<h4>Support Files</h4>

<p>Support files include VCS.H and MACRO.H

<li>Corrections made to the TIA_BASE_WRITE_ADDRESS and TIA_BASE_READ_ADDRESS.  See VCS.H for implementation comments.  Now allows command-line definition of these values for creating binary-copies of disassembled code via disassembly/reassembly process.  If not present, these values default to the TIA_BASE_ADDRESS values.  Thanks to MR for the suggestions and correction.

<li>Added TIA_BASE_WRITE_ADDRESS and TIA_BASE_READ_ADDRESS to vcs.h for convenient disassembly/reassembly compatibility for hardware mirrored reading/writing differences.  This is more a readability issue, and binary compatibility with disassembled and reassembled sources.  Per Manuel Rotschkar's suggestion.</li>

<td valign="TOP">Version 1.01<br></td><td valign="TOP">In VCS.H, TIA_BASE_ADDRESS constant now sets the base address of the TIA access. This supports 3F-style bankswitching, where TIA registers are defined from $40 up, as opposed to normal usage which is from 0 up.  Use -DTIA_BASE_ADDRESS=$40 on the command line, or define a label with that value before including VCS.H, if you're creating a 3F-style binary, otherwise don't worry about it;  the addresses will resolve to 0 upwards if the label/constant isn't defined.  The default has all TIA registers with a base address of 0.  Thanks to Eckhard Stolberg for the diagnosis on this one.<p>Note: One should *NEVER* modify VCS.H - it is written to respond to external constants.</td></tr>
