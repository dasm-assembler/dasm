========================
Notes on Release Process
========================

This is just a proposal, I am following it for now but no
need for fighting over it.

1. Decide on a SVN revision to release.

2. Run "make alpha" in src; send archive to volunteers who verify
   that DASM still builds on their machines; ask for uname -a or
   something to identify where it worked and where it didn't.

3. Fix anything that needs fixing, otherwise just record that it
   went fine and on which machines.

4. Run "make beta" in trunk; send archive to volunteers who
   verify that DASM still actually works, either using the
   test cases from the beta archive or their own; ask for
   feedback (which essentially is a bug report at this point).

5. Fix anything that needs fixing, otherise just record that it
   went fine. If a bug can't be fixed right now, be sure to add
   it to the appropriate tracker on sf.net or to the BUGS file.

6. Make sure all the version numbers are changed in the DASM
   code and in the documentation; update the NEWS and ChangeLog
   files from SVN logs and whatever you recall we did; all the
   other last-minute stuff that won't break anything.

7. Tag the release in SVN using

     svn cp trunk tags/froehlich/dasm-x.yy.zz

   at leasts as long as Peter Froehlich is the maintainer and
   general project czar.

8. Run "make dist" in trunk; ftp the archive to sf.net and put
   it up as a new version; write a news item about the version;
   post to dasm-dillon-announce@lists.sf.net; maybe post to a
   few other lists; update freshmeat.net project; submit an item
   to atariage.com; etc.

9. Relax. Take a shower. Hack some on DASM. Goto 1. :-)

10. Give up on DASM. :-/

I see no need to tag alpha and beta releases in SVN, but maybe
we should?
