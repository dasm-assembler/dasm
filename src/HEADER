We're sticking with Matt's 1988 claim, even though ftohex.c
had a 1987 copyright originally, and Matt released version
2.0 in 1988, making a 1987 version 1.x likely. It's just not
available anywhere, not even from Matt... :-/ We're also
extending his copyright to 2002 compared to Andrew's release
since we plan on integrating more of Matt's 2.16 stuff.

Note that this header only lists the "main" maintainers and
not all contributors. Those are listed in the AUTHORS file,
and sometimes their contributions are in the NEWS file or
other documentation. Note entirely sure that this is right,
but the alternative is to have a *really* long list of
copyright lines in every single file... :-/
