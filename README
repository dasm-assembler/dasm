DASM 2.20.15-SNAPSHOT readme
============================

    Welcome to DASM, a versatile macro assembler with support for several
    8-bit microprocessors including MOS 6502 & 6507; Motorola 6803, 68705,
    and 68HC11; Hitachi HD6303 (extended Motorola 6801) and Fairchild F8.

    Download the latest compiled & packaged version of DASM from here:
    https://github.com/dasm-assembler/dasm/releases/latest

    For a comprehensive User Guide to using DASM, grab:

    This file describes the DASM source distribution, how to compile DASM, 
    and where to get more information.

    DASM's homepage is https://dasm-assembler.github.io/

Binary Releases
---------------

    In case you're running Windows, macOS or Linux and just want to download 
    and use DASM, please go directly to the releases:

----------------
The Distribution
----------------

    The DASM distribution contains the following important files and
    directories of interest to all users:

        docs/            Documentation and manuals
        docker/          Contains files & instructions to create a docker
                         image to run a 'dasm build machine' container
        machines/        Support files for various 8-bit machines
        LICENSE          GNU General Public License
        NEWS             Recent changes to DASM
        README           The file you are reading right now :-)

    In addition, developers are going to be interested in the following
    files and directories:

        src/        Source code for DASM and related tools
        test/       Test cases for DASM and related tools
                    (as of release 2.20.11 the test framework is incomplete)
        bin/        This is were the compiled executables for DASM and
                    related tools will be placed after you do a 'make'
        research/   A directory where we keep experiments
        ChangeLog   Source level changes to DASM
        Makefile    Makefile to build DASM executables, run tests, and
                    create distributions

    Even more files for developers are available from the DASM GitHub
    repository, see https://github.com/dasm-assembler/dasm for details.

---------
Compiling
---------

    If you are using DASM on a Unix system, you should be able to simply
    give the command

        make

    in the root directory of the DASM distribution and DASM should build.
    A bin/ directory containing DASM executables will be created as part
    of this process. You can also give the command

        make test

    to run all the test cases that come with the distribution. Note that
    as of release 2.20.11 the test framework is incomplete and probably
    only remotely comprehensible for developers. :-/ The often-used

    NOTE: Several compiler warnings will be displayed during the build
          process. We are confident that you can ignore these warnings.
          They will be dealt with in a future release. (And if you know
          how to fix them reliably, we welcome your contributions!)

    DASM has been built and tested successfully on recent versions of Linux,
    macOS, BSD and Windows.

    If you have successfully built and tested DASM on a different machine
    or operating system, we would love to hear about it.

----------
Using DASM
----------

    The simplest way to get a brief introduction to DASM is to run the
    bin/dasm executable without options, which will print a short help
    message summarizing all available options.

    For a comprehensive User Guide to using DASM, grab:
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dasm-assembler/dasm/master/docs/dasm.pdf    

    Documentation for using DASM to produce code for the F8 processor
    is currently in the directory machines/channel-f/ but will be
    integrated into the main documentation in the future.

    Bugs? Feature requests?
    Please report bugs or feature requests on our dasm project page.
    See https://github.com/dasm-assembler/dasm
    All versions of dasm are written in C. If you want to contribute 
    we encourage you to fork dasm and send us pull requests!

    There is also a vibrant community of developers writing games and
    demos for the Atari 2600 VCS using DASM. The mailing lists for the
    Stella emulator are a particularly useful resource for DASM users,
    not only those intent on programming for the VCS.
