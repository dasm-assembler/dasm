    For files that are C but don't have a standard file extension,
    like the errors.x file for example, this switches on C syntax
    highlighting in vim. Also, it sets up "tabs" the right way for
    DASM hacking: no tabs at all, but "simulate" them for editing.

    Good to have in every file anyway, just take out or adapt the
    syntax stuff as needed...

    Note: Modelines have to be within the first or last five lines
    of a file, I usually keep them at the end.
